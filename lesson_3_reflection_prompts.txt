When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local? in case you work from different computer's or platforms. or in case someone else is working on the program with you
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository? because you may be working on a feature that is made up with more then one or several commits and you wouldn't want them to go public prematurely
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another? I would use a fork when I'm working on someone elses program that I want to modify my own version of it and I don't have permission to modify their repository. I would clone when I want to work locally on my home file so I can be specific on what I share of my new version on git hub, and branching is for me locally to update my sub versions of the program.
