When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local? in case you work from different computer's or platforms. or in case someone else is working on the program with you
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository? because you may be working on a feature that is made up with more then one or several commits and you wouldn't want them to go public prematurely
