When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local? in case you work from different computer's or platforms. or in case someone else is working on the program with you
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository? because you may be working on a feature that is made up with more then one or several commits and you wouldn't want them to go public prematurely
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another? I would use a fork when I'm working on someone elses program that I want to modify my own version of it and I don't have permission to modify their repository. I would clone when I want to work locally on my home file so I can be specific on what I share of my new version on git hub, and branching is for me locally to update my sub versions of the program.
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally? If I was going to be working on a program or file before getting on a plane or anywhere else that didn't have internet access I could continue to work from the last commit on the github repository while offline.
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder? Well it would be allot faster and easier using pull requests because not only does a pull request show your collaborator the code that your working on without you updating the entire file directory. it will run git diff for them to see the changes. going back and forth would be very time consuming and this greatly expediates the pull process.
